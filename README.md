# FitLit

FitLit is a proof-of-concept for a fitness tracking web application. The app breaks down a users hydration, sleep patterns, step goal levels, and present it on a dashboard. It runs in the web browser.

### `Technologies and Skills`

FitLit uses...
* HTML and CSS adhering to BEM naming conventions.
* Old School Vanilla JavaScript (OSVJS).
* [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for unit testing. 
* [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) to format dates on the DOM.

## `Architecture`
FitLit currently uses API data found in the first linked repo. Most of the functionality is housed in our `src` folder, which includes all of our classes (ex: `User-Class.js`) as well as our JS logic (`scripts.js`), HTML (`index.html`), and CSS (`styles.css`). We also have a testing suite, housed in our `test` folder.
